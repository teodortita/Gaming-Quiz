# GamingQuiz

Personal Project

## Description

I have developed a single-page web application (SPA) illustrating a multiple choice quiz regarding video games. I have used the CSS Grid Layout and media queries for the responsive behaviour of the user interface (the view), in a mobile-first design pattern. The content of the HTML “body” element is being generated exclusively by a JavaScript file, through extensive use of DOM manipulation, functions and event listeners (controllers). All the data for the quiz (the model) is stored in an array of objects. Each object also contains a suitable gif. Furthermore, there has been implemented a scoring system, with the possibility of replaying the quiz.
